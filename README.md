A robust, production-ready [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.dev) server for interacting with the [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) headless CMS. This server provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating, reading, updating, and deleting objects, types, and media in your Cosmic bucket.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive Toolset:** Full CRUD operations for Cosmic objects, object types, and media.
- **Robust Architecture:** Built with a clean, three-layer architecture (Server, Services, Repositories).
- **Strongly Typed:** Written in TypeScript with strict validation using Zod for all inputs.
- **Production-Ready:** Includes centralized logging, rate-limiting, and graceful error handling.
- **Easy to Configure:** Simple setup using a `.env` file for your Cosmic credentials.
- **Extensible:** Designed to be easily extended with new tools and services.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0 or higher)
- A [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) account and bucket.

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patgpt/cosmic-mcp.git
cd cosmic-mcp
bun install
```

### 2. Configuration

Copy the example environment file and fill in your Cosmic bucket credentials. You can find these in your Cosmic dashboard under _Bucket > Settings > API Keys_.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```dotenv
# .env
COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG="your-bucket-slug"
COSMIC_READ_KEY="your-read-key"
COSMIC_WRITE_KEY="your-write-key"
DEBUG="false" # Set to "true" for verbose logging
```

### 3. Running the Server

Start the MCP server using the following command:

```bash
bun start
```

The server will connect and be ready to receive requests from any MCP-compatible client.

### 4. Using with MCP Clients

#### For VS Code (using Claude Dev extension)

Add this configuration to your VS Code settings or Claude Dev configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "Cosmic": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "cosmic-mcp"],
        "env": {
          "COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG": "your-bucket-slug",
          "COSMIC_READ_KEY": "your-read-key",
          "COSMIC_WRITE_KEY": "your-write-key",
          "DEBUG": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Cursor

Add this configuration to your `.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Cosmic": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cosmic-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG": "your-bucket-slug",
        "COSMIC_READ_KEY": "your-read-key",
        "COSMIC_WRITE_KEY": "your-write-key",
        "DEBUG": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Alternative: Local Development

If you're developing locally or prefer to use the local version:

**For VS Code:**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "Cosmic": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["path/to/cosmic-mcp/dist/server.js"],
        "env": {
          "COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG": "your-bucket-slug",
          "COSMIC_READ_KEY": "your-read-key",
          "COSMIC_WRITE_KEY": "your-write-key",
          "DEBUG": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Cursor:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Cosmic": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/cosmic-mcp/dist/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG": "your-bucket-slug",
        "COSMIC_READ_KEY": "your-read-key",
        "COSMIC_WRITE_KEY": "your-write-key",
        "DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Replace `your-bucket-slug`, `your-read-key`, and `your-write-key` with your actual Cosmic bucket credentials. You can find these in your Cosmic dashboard under _Bucket > Settings > API Keys_.
