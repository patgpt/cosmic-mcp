## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0 or higher)
- A [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) account and bucket.

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
bun install
```

### 2. Configuration

Copy the example environment file and fill in your Cosmic bucket credentials. You can find these in your Cosmic dashboard under _Bucket > Settings > API Keys_.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```dotenv
# .env
COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG="your-bucket-slug"
COSMIC_READ_KEY="your-read-key"
COSMIC_WRITE_KEY="your-write-key"
DEBUG="false" # Set to "true" for verbose logging
```

### 3. Running the Server

Start the MCP server using the following command:

```bash
bun start
```

The server will connect and be ready to receive requests from any MCP-compatible client.
